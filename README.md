# Arduino libraries

These are a few arduino libraries we are using in the UMD/JQI AMO group.

More info to come later, but...

## AD9954

This one is a class to handle SPI/serial communication with an AD9954 DDS chip.
Still in development, but currently supports single-frequency setpoints.

## LockFreq

This class handles a voltage input from a frequency lock signal, and updates the corresponding
DDS frequency to track the lock.
