/*! 
	# Summary/Rationale
	
	This is a bit wacky-hacky, but it's the best idea I could think of.
	The problem here is that I want to hide the attachInterrupt functions
	inside the SetListArduino class, but the attachInterrupt callback 
	cannot take any variables. Sadly, class methods are implicitly passed
	the class itself, ie, void firstTriggerInterrupt(SetListArduino::). 
	The hack we're using here is to create a static class SetListISR, which
	will call the SetListArduino class methods as appropriate. attachInterrupt
	will register callbacks in SetListISR, thus avoiding the above issue.

	The SetListArduino class is a singleton (ie, only one instance should
	ever be declared in an arduino sketch). This hack takes advantage of that,
	in that the SetListISR methods need to know which instance of SetListArduino
	to call the trigger interrupt methods on. In order for everything to work, 
	we had to pre-decide on what the singleton SetListArduino instance should be
	called; Dan and I decided SetListImage made the most sense. In the .cpp
	file, you'll see the declaration "extern SetListArduino SetListImage;"
	Then, these SetListISR static methods will call functions on the object
	SetListImage. All works as expected, but in the arduino sketch you'll be
	forced to use the name SetListImage, which is hopefully a *very* minor
	inconvenience!

        	This ISR is attached to SetListArduino::_triggerChannel on a falling

        	changes the ISR to trigger on `CHANGE` (ie, rising *or* falling 
        	edge).
        	
        	It is implemented this way because depending on whether SetList has
        	an even or odd number of lines, the PulseBlaster trigger channel
        	might be in a high or a low state, thus causing an off-by-one index
        	error in the SetList table.
